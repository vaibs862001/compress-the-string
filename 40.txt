
Compress the String:
Write a program to do basic string compression. For a character which is consecutively repeated more than once, replace consecutive duplicate occurrences with the count of repetitions.

For e.g. if a String has 'x' repeated 5 times, replace this "xxxxx" with "x5".

Note : Consecutive count of every character in input string is less than equal to 9.

Input Format :
Input string S

Output Format :
Compressed string

Sample Input:
aaabbccdsa

Sample Output:
a3b2c2dsa
